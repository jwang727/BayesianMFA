Data files for Figure 3. Note that the figures plotted are kernel density plots which are like histograms, plotted using the plot_trace function of the Arviz library.

So it's not possible to retrieve the exact points are plotted on the graph.

Instead I have provided the (posterior) samples for each flow or change in stock variable plotted, from which the plot can be generated and the mean and 95% HDI (highest density interval) of each variable calculated.
